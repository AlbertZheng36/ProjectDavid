How to collaborate and use arduino files?

1. You need to have your own Arduino IDE installed on your PC.
2. Copy the folder into your own arduino workspace which is located in documents/arduino/
3. Set up appropriate libraries, which we will have an up-to-date copy of in Git repo as well
4. Again, make sure your libraries are up-to-date. Also, please update the library in git if you download new libraries. 
5. Compile and load from Arduino IDE and you are good to go.
